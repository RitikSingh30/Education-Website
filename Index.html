                knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, habits, and personal development.[1] Education originated as
                transmission of cultural heritage from one generation to the next. Today, educational goals increasingly
                encompass new ideas such as liberation of learners, critical thinking about presented information,
                skills needed for the modern society, empathy and complex vocational skills.</p>

                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">UNESCO defines three main learning settings.[2] Formal education takes
                    place in education and training institutions, is usually structured by curricular aims and objectives,
                    and learning is typically guided by a teacher. In most regions, formal education is compulsory up to a
                    certain age and commonly divided into educational stages such as kindergarten, primary school and
                    secondary school. Nonformal learning occurs as addition or alternative to formal education. [3] It may
                    be structured according to educational arrangements, but in a more flexible manner, and usually takes
                    place in community-based, workplace-based or civil society-based settings. Lastly, informal settings
                    occurs in daily life, in the family, any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks,
                    feels, or acts may be considered educational, whether unintentional or intentional. In practice there is
                    a continuum from the highly formalized to the highly informalized, and informal learning can occur in
                    all three settings.[4] For instance, homeschooling can be classified as nonformal or informal, depending
                    upon the structure.
                    Regardless of setting, educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion, and
                    directed research. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy. Education is supported by a variety
                    of different philosophies, theories and empirical research agendas.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the
                knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved
                orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to
                the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned
                through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle
                Kingdom.[6]
                Matteo Ricci (left) and Xu Guangqi (right) in the Chinese edition of Euclid's Elements published in 1607
                Plato founded the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in Europe.[7] The city of
                Alexandria in Egypt, established in 330 BCE, became the successor to Athens as the intellectual cradle
                of Ancient Greece. There, the great Library of Alexandria was built in the 3rd century BCE. European
                civilizations suffered a collapse of literacy and organization following the fall of Rome in CE 476.[8]
